# Python_lab_exercise_2

1. Check whether 5 is in list of first 5 natural numbers or not. Hint: List => [1,2,3,4,5]
2. WAP which accepts marks of four subjects and display total marks, percentage and 
grade.
Hint: more than 70% –> distinction, more than 60% –> first, more than 40% –> pass, 
less than 40% –> fail
3. Check whether the user input number is even or odd and display it to user.
4. Given three integers, print the smallest one. (Three integers should be user input)
5. For given integer x, print ‘True’ if it is positive, print ‘False’ if it is negative and print ‘zero’ 
if it is 0.
6. Given an integer number, print its last digit.
7. Given a positive real number, print its fractional part. 
8. Given a three-digit number. Find the sum of its digits. 
9. Check whether the given year is leap year or not. If year is leap print ‘LEAP YEAR’ else 
print ‘COMMON YEAR’.
Hint: • a year is a leap year if its number is exactly divisible by 4 and is not 
exactly divisible by 100
• a year is always a leap year if its number is exactly divisible by 400
10. Write a Python program to sum of three given integers. However, if two values are 
equal sum will be zero.
11. What is the result of 10**3?
12. Given x = 5, what will be the value of x after we run x+=3?
13. What is the output of ‘APPLE’ > ‘apple’?
14. What is the result of float (1)?
15. What will be the output of the following if a =2, b=3, c =4, d = 3?
a) a == b
b) a != d
c) b == d
d) a != c
e) a += c
f) b /= d
g) b > a
h) a < d
i) b-a == c-b
j) b >=d
